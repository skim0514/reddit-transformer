Baseline GPT-3 models are contained in the GPT-3 folder. There are two functions that can be run alongside the dataset that can be downloaded. If you run through the entire script, this will run both models for the baseline GPT-3, one being the pretrained summary based model, and one being the finetuned, with the finetuning already being done previously.
